/**
 * <p>A few guidelines about creating an authentication providing plugin. TODO : document more extensively</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * 	Notes : 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Read dSpring security documentation, also read the code of SecurityConfig in module tm.service</li>
 * 
 * 	<li>
 * 		If your plugin is satisfied with the regular login/form entry point but want to swap how the authentication is done behind the curtain,
 * 		it can add an AuthenticationProvider to the primary AuthenticationManager. However, as the app and it quirks stand now, If you need to 
 * 		*replace* the primary AuthenticationProvider, you must also replace the primary AuthenticationManager. You can do so by : 
 * 
 * 		<ul>
 * 			<li>registering a GlobalAuthenticationConfigurerAdapter</li>
 * 			<li>defining the {@link AuthenticationProviderFeatures} of your provider</li>
 * 			<li>
 * 				changing the value of the application property 'authentication.provider' to the name of plugin. 'internal' is a reserved value used by the
 * 				native AuthenticationManager of Squash. 
 * 			</li>
 * 		</ul> 
 * 	</li>
 * 
 * 	<li>
 * 		If your plugin publish new endpoints for client authentication, their base url should all start by '(contextPath)/auth/your-service'. Eg '/squash/auth/your-service'.
 * 		You can then define and add your own security filter chain to the security context.  
 * 
 * 	</li>
 * 
 * </ul>
