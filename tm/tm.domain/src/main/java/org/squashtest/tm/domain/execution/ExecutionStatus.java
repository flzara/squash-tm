/*
 * Tech documentation :
 *
 * When asking for the new status of an Execution given its former state, and those of the modified step, the procedure
 * goes through multiple stages. It's a rather awkward procedure because the implementation first concern was
 * optimization rather than code clarity. Indeed we need to reduce calls to the database to the minimum because this
 * code may be called numerous times in a short period of time, especially since a recomputation requires to load the
 * complete collection of steps for the considered execution.
 *
 * To achieve the lowest number of db calls, we apply successive tests, from the less information-consuming to the most
 * information-consuming.
 *
 * Computation here is based on the table of truth of : former execution status, former step status, new step status.
 * From all the possible combinations obtained in that table we can deduce the tests mentioned above, and which
 * informations are required to deduce them. When no test can be deduced it usually means that a db call is needed.
 *
 * The tests are grouped in the following stages (in that order) :
 *
 * 1/ trivial deductions : we filter the table of truth with trivial computations wrt the former states of the execution
 * only. If the new status could be deducted it is returned immediately, otherwise we proceed to the next stage.
 *
 * 2/ check if computation is mandatory : another row of quick tests that will tell if a db call is unavoidable. If
 * that's the case the method returns null immediately, otherwise we proceed to the next stage. The calling method is
 * now in charge to call the db.
 *
 * 3/ Status-specific computations : we perform specific tests, like in the first one (trivial computation), this time
 * adding all the informations we have at disposal. If a result was found the method returns it immediately, otherwise
 * we proceed.
 *
 * 4/ Failure : none of the step above succeeded. The result is null, and the calling method must call the DB.
 *
 * See below for more comments about the various tests .
 *
 * Note 1 : impossible states like formerStepStatus = BLOCKED and formerExecStatus = SUCCESS are filtered out (they
 * aren't supposed to happen).
 *
 * Note 2 : see the method computeNewStatus for the simplest statement about what does this thing compute.
 */

/*
 * Feat 1181, 03/08/12 : the list of execution statuses is extended by two statuses designed for automated executions :
 * TA_WARNING and TA_ERROR. There are now 8 status, yet manual or automated statuses only uses a subset of them.
 *
 * The set of valid statuses for manual executions is : BLOCKED, FAILURE, SUCCESS, RUNNING, READY The set of valid
 * statuses for automated executions : ERROR, FAILURE, WARNING, SUCCESS, RUNNING, READY, NOT_RUN, NOT_FOUND
 *
 *
 * The status sets for manual and automated can still be compared to each other, but one have to normalize them first :
 * BLOCKED, FAILURE, SUCCESS, RUNNING, READY is considered as the Canonical status set. To this end, TA_ERROR and
 * TA_NOT_RUN is considered equal to BLOCKED, TA_NOT_FOUND is considered as UNTESTABLE, and TA_WARNING is considered equal to SUCCESS.
 */

/*
 * Feat 3481, 3482, 3483, 30/06/14 :
 *
 *  Two more TA statuses : NOT_RUN(BLOCKED) and NOT_FOUND(UNTESTABLE)
