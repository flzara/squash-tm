  We shamelessly map the fonts to (one of) their opensource equivalent right here
  and we do not ship the fonts themselves due to the GPL license covering most of the open source fonts.
  The extension of the GPL still doesn't allow us to embed the fonts in Squash since it covers the product
  of the report engine and not the report engine itself.

  Well this very file and package are open source, I guess you can add your own .ttf files, map them here
  and recompile the whole bundle yourself if you really need to.

    Note : extends that file to more fonts, and include DejaVu and Bitstream when really required.
