/**
 * <p>
 * Legacy compatiblity. When a controller returns a view name it usually includes '.html' at the end, however when resolving fragment the html is omitted. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Thymeleaf 3 template resolver cannot cope with this inconsistency anymore. In order to avoid breaking things we now make  the suffix optional, so that 
 * a view name can include .html or not in its name, as long as it resides in the /WEB-INF/templates folder it'll be fine.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The big TODO is of course to user always use .html (ie track all directives th:include and make sure they specify '.html' in the fragment name) or 
 * never use the suffix (ie track all views returned by a controller and remove the .html in its name).
 * </p>
