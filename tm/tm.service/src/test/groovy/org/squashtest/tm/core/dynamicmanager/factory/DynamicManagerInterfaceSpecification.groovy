/**
 * Superclass for testing the interface of a Dynamic Manager.
 * It tests that "change" methods of the dynamic manager are consistent with the enties they modify.
 *
 * Subclasses should have the following properties :
 * <code>@Shared Class managerType = <type of tested dynamic manager interface></code>
 * <code>@Shared Class entityType = <type of entity modified by the interface></code>
 * <code>@Shared List changeServiceCalls = [ { service -> service.changeFoo(id, value) }, { service -> service.changeBar(id, value) } ]</code>
