/**
 * <p>
 * 		Maps a user's credentials for a third party server, which is meant to last for a whole user session in order to maintain the credentials live.
 * 		Unlike regular cache, which is used for fastest retrieval, here it is rather used to keep user's credentials alive when they cannot or should not
 * 		be stored in the database as a {@link org.squashtest.tm.domain.servers.StoredCredentials}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *     	Whenever possible, the credentials should not be cached ^^ In general, letting sensitive that kind of  information living in memory for
 *     	long is not not safe security-wise. However due to half-baked requirements and half-finished job on that topic, the cache
 *     	is necessary because otherwise the credentials would have no place to persist otherwise.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 		For now the decision regarding caching or not caching is the following :
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         	BasicAuthentication credentials are (for now) never stored in the database, so there is no choice but keep them this cache.
 *     		Otherwise they would be lost when the thread ends, and the user would have to reenter them again.
 *     </li>
 * 		<li>
 * 		    On the other hand OAuth1a tokens are stored in the DB. In this case the right choice is to let them live in the DB rather
 * 			than in memory. OAuth1a credentials should thus never be cached.
 * 		</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 *     For the code historians, the philogenetic ancestor of that class was as BugTrackerContext, which has gone extinct circa Squash TM 1.18.
