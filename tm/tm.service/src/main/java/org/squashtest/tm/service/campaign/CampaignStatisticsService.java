/*
 * TODO : Some statistics here are computed on a set of campaigns (namely TestCaseStatusStatistics, TestCaseSuccessRateStatistics, NonExecutedTestCaseImportanceStatistics)
 * and hopefully some days TestInventoryStatistics). This set of campaign can be :
 * 	- reduced to one campaign,
 *  - all campaigns that belong to a milestone,
 *  - all campaigns that belong to a folder and a milestone if any.
 *
 *  and the list can go on maybe.
 *
 *  Undoubtfully many methods are triplicate and would benefit a refactor as with a single arguments List<Long> campaignIds.
 *  The problem for now is that 1) I'm getting lazy and 2) depending on the context some statistics aren't exactly the same
 *  (for instance the granularity of TestInventoryStatistics : they can be computed at campaign level or iteration level).
 *  (also the ProgressionStatistics are undefined for more than one campaign).
 *
 *  So I leave it there but if some day we have yet another set of methods to add (like, dashboard for Project), please do that refactoring.
 *
 *  Note : CampaignLibraryFinderService#findCampaignIdsFromSelection(Collection<Long> libraryIds, Collection<Long> nodeIds); 		// NOSONAR
 *  and CampaignDao#filterByMilestone(Collection<Long> campaignIds, Long milestoneId) might be useful to that end. If you can
 *  solve :
 *  - the inconsistencies regarding the TestInventory (that depends on the the context)
 *  - and the possible cyclic dependencies when injecting CampaignLibraryFinderService.
