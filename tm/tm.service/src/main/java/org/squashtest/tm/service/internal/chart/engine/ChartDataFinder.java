/**
 * <p>This is the class that will find the data matching the criteria supplied as a {@link ChartDefinition}, using the Querydsl engine.</p>
 *
 * <h1>What is this ?</h1>
 *
 * <p>A ChartDefinition defines what you need to formulate the query :
 *
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>What data you want to find (the {@link MeasureColumn}s)</li>
 * 	<li>On what basis you want them (the {@link AxisColumn}s)</li>
 * 	<li>How specific you need the data to be (the {@link Filter}s)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Based on this specification the {@link ChartDataFinder} will design the query plan and run it. The rest of this javadoc
 * is a technical documentation of its internal processes.</p>
 *
 * <h1>Column roles</h1>
 *
 * <p>Here we explain how these roles will be used in a query :</p>
 *
 * <h3>Filters</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	In a query they naturally fit the role of a where clause. However a regular where clause is a simple case : sometimes you would have
 * 	it within a Having clause, and in other times it could be a whole subquery.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>AxisColumns</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 *	These columns will be grouped on (in the group by clause). They also appear in the select clause and should of course not
 *	be subject to any aggregation function. In the select clause, they will appear first, and keep the same order as in the list defined in the ChartDefinition.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>MeasureColumn</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	These columns appear in the select clause and will be subject to an aggregation method. The aggregation is specified in the MeasureColumn.
 * 	They appear in the select clause, after the axis columns, and keep the same order as in the list defined in the ChartDefinition.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 	Most of the time no specific attribute will be specified : in this case the measure column defaults to the id of the observed entity.
 * 	For instance consider a measure which aggregation is 'sum' (count). If the user is interested to know how many test cases match the given filters,
 * 	the aggregation should be made on the test case ids. However if the user picked something more specific - like the test case labels -, the semantics
 * 	becomes how many different labels exist within the test cases that match the filter. This, of course, is a problem for the tool that will design
 * 	the ChartDefinition : the current class will just create and process the query.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Query plan</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	The global query is composed of one main query and several optional subqueries depending on the filters.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Domain</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	The total domain covered by any possible ChartDefinition is the following : </br></br>
 *
 * <table>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td>Campaign</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;-&gt;</td>
 * 		<td>Iteration</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;-&gt;</td>
 * 		<td>IterationTestPlanItem</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;-&gt;</td>
 * 		<td>TestCase</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;-&gt;</td>
 * 		<td>(RequirementVersionCoverage)</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;-&gt;</td>
 * 		<td>RequirementVersion</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;-&gt; </td>
 * 		<td>Requirement</td>
 * 	</tr>
 * 	<tr>
 * 		<td>Issue</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;-&gt;</td>
 * 		<td>Execution</td>
 * 		<td>&lt;--</td>
 * 		<td>^</td>
 * 		<td></td>
 * 		<td></td>
 * 		<td></td>
 * 		<td></td>
 * 		<td></td>
 * 		<td></td>
 * 	</tr>
 * </table>
 *
 *  </p>
 *
 * 	<p>Depending on the ChartDefinition, a main query will be generated as
 * 	a subset of this domain. The specifics of its construction depend on the "Root entity", "Target entities" and
 * 	"Support entities", those concepts are defined below. </p>
 *
 * 	<h3>Main query</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 *	see {@link QueryPlanner}.
 * 	The main building blocks that defines the main query are the following :
 *
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li><b>Root Entity</b> : This is the entity from which the query plan begins the entity traversal. The root entity is the
 * 		entity targeted by the AxisColumn.  When multiple target entities are eligible, the one with the lowest rank will be the Root entity.</li>
 * 		<li><b>Target Entities</b> : entities on which apply at least one of the MeasureColumns, AxisColumns, Filters, or Scope (see <b>Scope and ACLs</b>)</li>
 * 		<li><b>Support Entities</b> : entities that aren't Target entities but must be joined on in order to join together all
 * 			the Target entities. For example if a ChartDefinition defines Execution as Root entity and Campaign as a TargetEntity,
 * 			then IterationTestPlanItem and Iteration are Support entities.
 *              </li>
 * 	</ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *  The main query is thus defined as the minimal subset of the domain that join all the Target entities together via
 *  Support Entities, starting with the Root entity. All joins in this query will be inner joins (no left nor right joins).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *      <b>Clarification about the Scope and the Main Query (custom scopes only, TM 1.14):</b>
 *      As of TM 1.14 the Scope is now included in order to force a natural joins on the scoped entity. Indeed, when the user defines a query on which the
 *      scoped entity is neither used in a Filter, Axis or Measure, the resulting data is void because the Root Entity or Support entities are indeed out of the scope.
 *      This decision is only half satisfactory : the definitive solution would be to actually reify and handle a Domain on which the query should innerjoin on,
 *      but for now this trick will avoid the main problem (ie the case of empty resultset). See more with tickets #6260 and #6275
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Select clause generation</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	The select clause must of course contain the MeasureColumns with their appropriate aggregation function (like count(distinct ), avg(distinct ) etc).
 * 	For technical reasons they must also include the AxisColumns, because theses are the column on which a row is grouped by.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Filter application</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Filters are restriction applied on the tuples returned by the main query.
 * 	At the atomic level a filter is a combination of a column, an comparison operator, and
 * 	one/several operands. They are translated in the appropriate Querydsl expression,
 * 	bound together by appropriate logical operators then inserted in the main query.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Mostly they are no more complex than "where" clauses, but in some cases
 * 	a subquery is required. Filters are treated according to the following process :
 *
 *  <ol>
 *  	<li>Filters are first grouped by Target Entity</li>
 *  	<li>Filters from each groups are then combined in a logical combination</li>
 *  	<li>For each filter happens one of theses :
 *  		<ul>
 *  			<li>inlined as a where clause in the main query</li>
 *  			<li>subquery + where or having clause</li>
 *  		 </ul>
 *  	</li>
 *  </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h4>logical combination</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Each Filter apply on one column (eg, TestCase.label). Typically, multiple filters will apply on several
 * 	columns. However one can stack multiple Filters on the same column, (eg TestCase.label = 'bob', TestCase.label = 'mike').
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	For each entity, the filters are thus combined according to the following rules :
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>Filters applied to the same column will be OR'ed together</li>
 * 		<li>Filters applied to different columns will be AND'ed</li>
 * 	</ul>
 *
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h4>Inlined where clause strategy</h4>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	In the simplest cases the filters will be inlined in the main query, if the column is of type {@link ColumnType#ATTRIBUTE}
 * </p>
 *
 * <h4>Subquery strategy</h4>
 *
 * <p>In more complex cases a subquery will be required. The decision is driven by the attribute 'columnType' of the {@link ColumnPrototype}
 * 	referenced by the filters : if at least one of them is of type {@link ColumnType#CUF} or {@link ColumnType#CALCULATED}
 * then one/several subqueries will be used. We need them for the following reasons :
 *
 * 	<ol>
 * 		<li>Custom fields : joining on them in the main query would cause massive tuples growth and headaches about how grouping on what</li>
 * 		<li>Aggregation operations (calculated attributes) : count(), avg() etc + Having clauses would be incorrect here because the result would be affected by the
 * 			other filters applied on the main query.</li>
 * 	</ol>
 *
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Subqueries have them own Query plan, and are joined with the main query as follow : the bean of the outer query that defines the
 * calculated attribute will join with the root entity of the subquery (usually its axis).
 * 	We choose to use correlated subqueries (joining them as described above) even when an uncorellated would do fine, because in
 * practice a clause
 * 	<pre> where exists (select 1 from ... where ... and inner_col = outer_col) </pre>
 * will outperform
 * 	<pre> where bean.id in (select id from .... where ...) </pre>
 * by several order of magnitude (especially because in the former the DB can then use the indexed primary keys).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Grouping</h3>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Data will be grouped on each {@link AxisColumn} in the given order. Special care is given for columns of
 * 	type {@link DataType#DATE} : indeed the desired level of aggregation may be day, month etc. We must be watchful
 * 	of not grouping together every month of December accross the years. For this reason data grouped by Day will
 * 	actually grouped by (year,month,day). Same goes for grouping by month, which actually mean grouping by (year,month)
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Result </h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	The result will be an array of array of Object. Each row represents a tuple of (x+m) cells, where x = card(AxisColumn)
 * 	and y = card(MeasureColumn). The first batch of cells are those of the AxisColumns, the second batch are those of the
 * 	MeasureColumns.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Note : a more appropriate representation would be one serie per MeasureColumn, with each tuple made of the x axis cells
 * 	and 1 measure cell. However we prefer to remain agnostic on how the resultset will be interpreted : series might not
 * 	be the preferred way to consume the data after all.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Scope and ACLs</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	Additionally, another special filter will be processed : the Scope, ie the subset of RootEntity on which
 *  the chart query will be applied to. At runtime it is refined into an Effective Scope, which is the conjunction of :
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>the content of the projects/folders/nodes selected by the user <b>who designed</b> the ChartDefinition (the scope part)</li>
 * 		<li>the nodes that can actually be READ by the user <b>who is running</b> the ChartDataFinder (the acl part)</li>
 * 	</ul>
 *
 * 	An amusing side effect of this is that the user may end up with no data available for plot.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * 	 The Effective Scope will be computed then added to the query after is has been generated. See {@link ScopePlanner} for details on what is going on.
 * </p>
